### Final Project Deliverable Instructions

In addition to delivering a presentation on your project at the end of the course, you are required to submit
your **presentation slides**, a **written description** of your project, and project **code**. These should be uploaded
to a **personal github repo** that will be shared with the course instructors.

This personal repo should be useful beyond the course, as it gives you an easy way to showcase/share your work with others, including potential employers. 

#### Presentation Slides
* These should be the exact slides you use for presenting, and should be uploaded as a pdf. 

#### Written Description
* ~1 page summarizing your work.
* Begin with a ~100 word abstract highlighting the key details.
* Follow the abstract with a breakdown of your project along the **5 major components**: design, data, algorithms, tools, communication.
* See this [classification project writeup](./project_deliverable_examples/classification/classification_writeup_ex.md) for a good example.

#### Code
* Include any code files that were part of your project process or were used to create your final results, organized in the repo as you see fit.
* Clean code is always desirable, but there's no need to prioritize cleanup for this submission; most important is that instructors can see your work. We definitely do recommend that you return to polish your code later on as you have time so that you can provide the best representation of your work to those who look at your github.
