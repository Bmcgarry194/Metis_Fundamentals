Guidlines for pair programming

# Pair "Drivers"

For each pair, use this to help you decide who will be the "driver" (i.e., the typer or coder) for the pair problem:

Day of the Week	| Decision Function
--- | ---
Monday | first letter of last name **earliest** in the alphabet
Tuesday | **earliest** birthday month (or date if same month)
Wednesday | more letters in first name
Thursday | first letter of last name **latest** in the alphabet
Fridays | **latest** birthday month (or date if same month)
