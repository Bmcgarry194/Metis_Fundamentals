# Google Cloud Computing

This lesson is an instructional guide on setting up a functional Google Cloud virtual machine, including the use of a file transfer system and jupyter notebook for coding. It is likely most useful to students who need access to more powerful computing resources than they can access on their local machine (e.g. a GPU for training a neural network, or more RAM for training a large-scale traditional model).

GCP provides **$300 of free credits** to new users, but we still recommend consulting the pros/cons list [here](../README.md) before commiting to a specific cloud solution.  

## Sample Lesson Plan

- (45 minutes) Walk through as a class setting up a GCP instance. It would be hard for them to go through this on their own, but setting up the instance on the dashboards should be relatively quick as a class. Expect to spend time on the material in the terminal (e.g. setting up SSH keys and config). Details are in [GCP Setup](gcp-setup.md)


## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to:
- Set up a simple GCP virtual machine.
- Install Anaconda
- Copy and run a Jupyter notebook
