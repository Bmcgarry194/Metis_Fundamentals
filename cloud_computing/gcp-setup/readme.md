# Google Cloud Computing

This lesson is an instructional guide on setting up a functional Google Cloud virtual machine, including the use of a file transfer system and jupyter notebook for coding. It is likely most useful to students who need access to more powerful computing resources than they can access on their local machine (e.g. a GPU for training a neural network, or more RAM for training a large-scale traditional model).

GCP provides **$300 of free credits** to new users, but we still recommend consulting the pros/cons list [here](../README.md) before commiting to a specific cloud solution.  

## Sample Lesson Plan

- (45 minutes) Walk through setting up a [GCP instance](gcp-setup.md)


## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to:
- Set up a simple GCP virtual machine
- Install Anaconda on that VM
- Run a Jupyter notebook on that machine, accessed in the browser
