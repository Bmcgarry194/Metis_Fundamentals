# Sample Lesson Plan

- (45 minutes) Walk through as a class setting up a GCP instance. It would be hard for them to go through this on their own, but setting up the instance on the dashboards should be relatively quick as a class. Expect to spend time on the material in the terminal (e.g. setting up SSH keys and config). Details are in [GCP Setup](gcp-setup.md)


# Learning Objectives

Students will be able to:
- Set up a simple GCP virtual machine.
- Install Anaconda
- Copy and run a Jupyter notebook
