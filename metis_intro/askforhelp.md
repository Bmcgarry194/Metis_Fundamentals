# How to Ask for Help
## An Order of Operations

### Google (15 - 20 minutes)

Google/stackoverflow will be your best friend when working through your projects. If you run into an error you don’t understand, try Googling the error message and see what you find. This can be very helpful, but be careful not to use code that you don’t understand. Make sure that for whatever solution you find online, you do your due diligence to understand the solution and how it is solving your problem.

As you debug and Google to answer your own questions, it will get easier and easier!


### (Only for Live Online) Ask your project group! 

If Googling isn’t giving you any promising leads in the first 10 -15 minutes, ask your project group if they have encountered a similar problem or have an idea for a solution. One of the greatest benefits of the bootcamp format is having a community to rely on and learn from, so make use of it! 


### Post question on Slack in the #help_me channel

If your project group doesn't have a clearer idea about how to solve the problem, post in the #help_me Slack channel to see if any other students can help out. Feel free to @ a TA or instructor if you are still having trouble.

### Come to Office Hours!

Sometimes it's helpful to talk through your question with an instructor or TA in a setting where other students can build on your question with an instructor's or TA's guidance.. 

### Book a 1:1 on Appointlet with TA or instructor

If the question cannot be resolved with a message on Slack or during Office Hours, book a 1:1. TA 1:1s should be more focused on debugging or specific code syntax while 1:1s with instructors are more conceptual/big picture focused. These are not hard and fast rules, so use your best judgment here.
