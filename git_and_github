# Git and Github Setup Instructions

**Git** is a version control software commonly used to help manage projects with one or many contributors. 
**Github** is its accompanying online platform that allows for remote storage and access of git repositories, 
making it a very helpful tool for collaboration across teams. Of course, the Metis Fundamentals content is itself a github repo!

Metis uses git and github to maintain and distribute course content -- students will therefore become comfortable with
the basics of git, able to **clone and update repos and resolve merge conflicts** using command line. Our goal is not that you will become
a git expert, but rather that you will be able to practically use it to access the course content you need while gaining some familiarity with version control. 

* If you are **cloning a course repo for the first time** or need a refresher on the workflow, see the detailed instructions [here](./git_setup.md)
